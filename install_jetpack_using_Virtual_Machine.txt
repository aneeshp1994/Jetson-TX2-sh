To configure the Ubuntu VM so it can access the Ethernet interface and the Jetson TX2 USB interface.

1. **Important**
Setup the Jetson TX2 is Force Recovery Mode *now* and leave it like that - you need to do this so that it appears in the Virtual Machine USB settings

2. Disk Space
The Ubuntu VM needs enough disk space so set this to 64GB when you create it - 25GB was not enough

3. Under the VM Settings:
** Do this BEFORE you start the VM **

	Network -> Enable Network Adapter; Bridged Adapter, en0: Ethernet

	Ports -> USB -> Enable USB Controller; USB 3.0 (xHCI) Controller ... and then

	In the USB Device Filters section, add a new filter by clicking the 'plus' icon on the right
	You should see NVIDIA Corp. APX [0102] - add that
	If you don't see it, try resetting the Jetson TX2 into Force Recovery Mode again
	If the Enable USB Controller text is greyed out then your VM might already be running. Shut it down and try again

4. run 'ifconfig'
	You should see an IP address on your network under the Ethernet interface
	This will have a different name on the VM - in my case it was enp0s3 instead of en0 but the IP address was in the correct range

5. run 'lsusb'
	You should see the NVIDIA device in the list:
	Bus 001 Device 003: ID 0955:7721 NVidia Corp.

6. If both of those are correct then you can move on to installing JetPack

	I just followed these instructions from NVidia:

	https://developer.nvidia.com/embedded/dlc/jetpack-l4t-3_3

7. (Important) When a window pops up asking you to put the TX2 into Forced Recovery Mode, then just hit Return - you've already done this

8 .This all takes a while - there are a lot of moving parts - but if all goes well it will complete and boot up a new Ubuntu desktop on the TX2
Note that the new session is under user 'nvidia' - the default password is 'nvidia'

9 .If it all works then go to the TX2 and cd to:
	~./NVIDIA_CUDA-8.0_Samples/bin/aarch64/linux/release/smokeParticles
